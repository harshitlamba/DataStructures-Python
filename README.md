# DataStructures-Python
This repository contains a brief overview and implementation of the most common data structures used in computer science, specifically:
a) Linked List - Singly and Doubly
b) Stack (both array and linked list implementation)
c) Queue (both array and linked list implementation) - Simple, Circular, Priority, Deque
d) Trees (both array and linked list implementation) - Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree
e) Graphs
f) Heap

This is still work in progress and I will continue to add new codes regularly. I have tried best to perform user-testing, however in case you still find any bugs, please feel free to contribute! For algorithms, I have another repository that might use some of the data structures code base (example, for performing BFS you will need queue DS), but it would be a more plain version, in that all the frills like user options, user inputs and user testing won't be there. So, enjoy the learning! Also, be a darling and put the reference in case you use it for your purpose!

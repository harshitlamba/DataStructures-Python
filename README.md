# DataStructures-Python
This repository contains a brief overview and implementation of the most common data structures (using Python 3.8) used in computer science, specifically:
- Linked List - Single and Double
- Stack (both array and linked list implementation)
- Queue (both array and linked list implementation) - Simple, Circular, Priority, Deque
- Trees (both array and linked list implementation) - Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree
- Graphs
- Heap

This is still work in progress and I will continue to add new codes regularly. I have tried best to perform user-testing, however in case you still find any bugs, please feel free to contribute! For algorithms, I have another repository that might use some of the data structures code base (example, for performing BFS you will need queue DS), but it would be a more plain version, in that all the frills like user options, user inputs and user testing won't be there. So, enjoy the learning! Also, be a darling and put the reference in case you use it for your purpose!

A big shout out to [mycodeschool](https://www.youtube.com/user/mycodeschool) for its invaluable succinct tutorials!
